        <h4>What are other sites doing right?</h4>
        <p>
          Sites like PriceCharting and GameFAQs are pretty useful. PriceCharting
          keeps track of game prices, and GameFAQs has a ton of guides made by
          other gamers. There are also forums and YouTube channels where
          collectors share tips and info.

        <h4>What are they doing wrong?</h4>
        <p>
          A lot of these sites can be messy or hard to use. Forums are full of
          old posts, and it’s tough to tell what info is actually legit. Price
          guides don’t always show trends over time, and troubleshooting help is
          all over the place, so you have to dig through a bunch of sites to
          find what you need.

        <h4>How will this site be better?</h4>
        <p>
          This site keeps things simple and easy to find. No more scrolling
          through endless forum threads or sketchy websites—everything will be
          in one place. Clear guides, updated prices, and troubleshooting tips
          without all the extra hassle.
