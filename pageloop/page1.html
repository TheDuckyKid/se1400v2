        Pong is a 1972 sports video game developed and published by Atari for
        arcades. It is one of the earliest arcade video games; it was created by
        Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder
        Nolan Bushnell, but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were
        surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the
        game. Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic ping-pong game
        included in the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console. In
        response, Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement.
